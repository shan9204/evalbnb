    x PM order alterable for a VM (according to resources free or initial allocation)
    x Logging: how does "best cost so far" change during the algorithm
    x Terminate when running for x seconds
    x Bound also when the cost is near the "best cost so far"
    x Other sorting methods for PMs (max or sum of resources)
    x Run profiler
    x Upper bound for the number of migrations
    x Iterative cost computation
    x Other sorting methods for VMs 
    x VMs with no initial PM (allocating these never cause migrations)
    x Generator should create more realistic problems
    x Bound: determine a minimal cost for the unallocated VMs (lower bound for the complete allocation)
    x ILP comparison

TODO:
    Anti-affinities (some VMs cannot be placed on the same PM)
    Initialize BB's "best cost so far" with the heuristic
	Implement for ILP: lower bound
	Implement for ILP: detailed costs
	Eliminate warnings
	Improve BB's lower bound by taking into account the number of migrations necessary to eliminate PM overloads
	Implement population-based heuristic for comparison

Advanced TODO:
    Give some allocation even when the problem is unsolvable (+different priorities for VMs)
